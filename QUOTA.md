# Understanding the Effective TPU Quota

The TPU quota can be retrieved at https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas.

## Resource type

**Preemptible resources** are resources that the user may lose access to at any time and has a 24 hour run time limit.<br>
https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/preemptible

**Spot resources** is a newer version of `preemptible` resources, and they share the same quotas. Generally, there's no reason to choose `preemptible` over `spot`, since `spot` VM can be queued while `preemptible` VM cannot, and `spot` VM can last for > 1 days, while `preemptible` VM cannot.

**On-demand resources** can be held by the user for as long as they wish and would not be preempted.

## Rule of thumb for estimating effective quota

The number of usable TPU cores is mainly limited by the following factors:<br>
(1) Maximum number of in-use external IP addresses according quota<br>
By default, this number is 8 for every zone. This can be raised by contacting the TPU Research Cloud team.<br>
(2) Maximum number of cores in the zone (e.g., europe-west4-a) according to quota<br>
Note that this number is shared between pod cores (e.g., v4-16 or above) and cores (e.g., v4-8) or between `preemptible` / `spot` resources and `on-demand` resources.<br>
(3) Availability of TPUs in the zone (e.g., europe-west4-a)

## Checking quotas on command line

### For TPU related quota
```
gcloud beta quotas info describe {the resource you're interested in} --service=tpu.googleapis.com --project={project name}
```
"the resource you're interested in" can be (a non-complete list):<br>
`TPUV5sLitepodPerProjectPerRegionForTPUAPI`<br>
`TPUV5sLitepodPerProjectPerZoneForTPUAPI`<br>
`TPUV5sPreemptibleLitepodPerProjectPerRegionForTPUAPI`<br>
`TPUV5sPreemptibleLitepodPerProjectPerZoneForTPUAPI`

`TPUV6EPerProjectPerRegionForTPUAPI`<br>
`TPUV6EPerProjectPerZoneForTPUAPI`<br>
`TPUV6EPreemptiblePerProjectPerRegionForTPUAPI`<br>
`TPUV6EPreemptiblePerProjectPerZoneForTPUAPI`
